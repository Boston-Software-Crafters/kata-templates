# Code Kata Templates

This repo blank projects and instructions for setting up development environments to work on code Katas.

A complete development environment consists of:

- An editor with auto-completion for the target language
- A minimal entrypoint (main file) that can be built and run
- A minimal unit test that can be built and run

Each subdirectory contains setup instructions.
