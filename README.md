# Code Kata Templates

This repo contains blank projects and instructions for setting up development environments to work on code Katas.

A complete development environment consists of:

- An editor with auto-completion for the target language
- A minimal entrypoint (main file) that can be built and run
- A minimal unit test that can be built and run

To set up an environment, clone this repo and refer to the instructions in the relevant environment subdirectory:

```
git clone https://github.com/alexjball/kata-templates.git
cd kata-templates/node
...
```
